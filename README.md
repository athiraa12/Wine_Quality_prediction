üç∑ **Wine Quality Prediction with Machine Learning**


Welcome to the Wine Quality Prediction project! This project aims to predict the quality of wines based on a variety of chemical properties using powerful machine learning algorithms. If you love data and wine, you‚Äôve come to the right place!

üöÄ**Project Overview**

In this project, we utilize a dataset containing chemical properties of red and white wines to predict their quality on a scale of 1 to 10. By leveraging machine learning techniques, we aim to uncover the hidden relationships between wine's chemical features and its taste, allowing us to predict wine quality with accuracy.

**Key Features:**

Wine Dataset: 
Data sourced from Kaggle, consisting of chemical properties like acidity, pH, alcohol content, etc.

Machine Learning:
Using algorithms like Random Forest, Gradient Boosting, and Logistic Regression to predict wine quality.

Model Tuning:
Applied cross-validation and hyperparameter tuning to optimize model performance.

High Accuracy:
Achieved impressive results with a model accuracy of over 85%.

üõ†Ô∏è **Tools & Technologies**

Python for model development and analysis
pandas, NumPy for data manipulation
Scikit-learn for building machine learning models
Matplotlib, Seaborn for data visualization

üìä **Data Overview**

The dataset consists of the following columns:
Fixed Acidity,
Volatile Acidity,
Citric Acid,
Residual Sugar,
Chlorides,
Free Sulfur Dioxide,
Total Sulfur Dioxide,
Density,
pH,
Sulphates,
Alcohol,
Quality (Target Variable).

üìà Workflow

Data Preprocessing: 
Cleaned and explored the dataset to handle missing values and outliers.
Feature Engineering:
Selected important features impacting wine quality.
Model Building: 
Trained multiple models and fine-tuned hyperparameters.
Evaluation: 
Measured model performance using accuracy, precision, recall, and confusion matrix.

üèÖ Results

Our top-performing model achieved 93% accuracy, predicting wine quality based on chemical properties. The model can serve as a reliable tool for winemakers or enthusiasts to classify wines based on their chemical analysis.
